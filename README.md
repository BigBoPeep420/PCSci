# PCSci

A project with containing all of the different projects assigned in the JS Computer
Science section of The Odin Project curriculum. All projects contained in their own
folder inside /src/modules/.

Every project should have a .test.js in its folder that uses Jest. This is the main method used to test functionality.

If built, the index page will display some outputs from certain projects

Recursion
I skipped writing the Fibonacci function without recursion as I accomplished that in
an earlier assignment.
